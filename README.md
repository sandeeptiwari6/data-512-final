## Introduction
___
American prisons have become some of the most dangerous locations with respect to contracting COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 399075 and 2715 deaths, on average, have been reported inside those facilities each day. The cramped, and often unhygienic conditions of most correctional facilities have become a haven for the coronavirus to breed and transmit from inmate to inmate. Early on in the pandemic, most American prisons did not make testing a priority, and with very little pressure from the American people, policy-makers have been very sluggish to address the issue. The unfortunate fact is that prisons were simply not built to handle the full impact of a pandemic. There is probably not a word environment to prevent its spread—large groups of people living in a crowded indoor space, with indirect interactions to the outside world via correctional staff.

In this project, I considered taking a deeper dive into the impact that COVID-19 had on the United States’ prison system, by drilling down into data specifically describing Oklahoma and Oklahoma County. Because of conditions that are not conducive to preventing transmission, coronavirus spreads much faster in prisons than it does in the outside world. So, I hoped to be able to demonstrate the urgency to take proactive measures to address the crisis persisting within American prisons and detention centers. I decided to use data collected by the Marshall Project in order to highlight the discrepancies between rates of transmission of prisons and the general population. The purpose of this project extension is also to understand the ethical dilemma of prioritizing the wellbeing of those who wronged society in some way. I did end up finding out that American prisoners are contracting the coronavirus at a higher rate than the general population, and requires some internal or policy-level remediation to address this crisis.
